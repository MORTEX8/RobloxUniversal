-- This script changes the ambient color of the game's lighting to a deep red,
-- which affects the overall skybox appearance and lighting.

-- Get a reference to the Lighting service in the game.
-- The Lighting service controls various environmental properties, including ambient light.
local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")

-- Define the desired *much deeper* red color using RGB values.
-- Color3.fromRGB(R, G, B) creates a new Color3 object.
-- R, G, B values range from 0 to 255.
-- We've lowered the red component significantly to make it darker and more intense.
local deepRed = Color3.fromRGB(171, 128, 214) -- This is a very dark, intense red.

-- Set the Ambient property of the Lighting service to the deep red color.
-- The Ambient property controls the color of the ambient light in the scene,
-- which significantly influences the skybox and overall environment's tint.
Lighting.Ambient = deepRed

-- We are also setting the OutdoorAmbient property for a much more pronounced effect
-- on outdoor areas and the skybox itself, making the deep red more dominant.
Lighting.OutdoorAmbient = deepRed

-- To make the sky itself the same deep red color, we'll set ColorShift_Top and ColorShift_Bottom.
-- These properties directly control the color of the sky, blending from top to bottom.
-- Setting both to the same deep red will make the entire sky uniformly that color.
Lighting.ColorShift_Top = deepRed
Lighting.ColorShift_Bottom = deepRed

-- Optional: You might also want to adjust the Brightness or other properties
-- of the Lighting service to fine-tune the visual effect.
-- For example, to make the entire scene darker to emphasize the deep red:
-- Lighting.Brightness = 0.5 -- Adjust as needed (default is 2)

-- Print a message to the output window to confirm the script has run.
print("Skybox color and sky now changed to a much deeper red!")
